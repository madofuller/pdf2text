Appendix II
Product Pricing

(a) Price: The Selling Price (P) for Product will be determined each calendar month that this Agreement is in effect using
the following formula:

P=P,+229 x BZ + 0.270 x NH3 + 38.0 x NG

Where:

P = the selling price for Product in US$ per metric ton for the current calendar month, rounded to the nearest
whole dollar. Price may also be shown in US$ per Ib calculated by dividing selling price in US$ per metric ton by
2204.623 and rounding to two decimal places.

P, = 725 US$/metric ton

BZ = the North America Benzene Contract price for the month that is one month immediately previous to the
month Product is delivered, expressed in US cents per gallon (¢/gal) FOB US Gulf Coast, converted to
US$/gal, as published in the CMAI Market Advisory Services Market Reports “Aromatics Market Advisory
Service — North America”, applicable “Market Weekly Issue”, “Aromatics Market Report”, under the
heading, “United States”, “Benzene”, “Contract”, “Cents/Lb.” If more than one price is published in any
month, the Benzene price for that month will be the arithmetic average of the published prices for the month
rounded to three decimal places.

NH3 = the monthly average, rounded to three decimal places, of the weekly Tampa ammonia prices, as the
average of the weekly prices published from the 21° of the month two months prior to the current
month to the 20" of the month immediately preceding the current month, as published in the weekly
FERTECON AMMONIA REPORT, under the headings, ‘FERTECON PRICE SERVICE”, “AMMONIA
PRICE INDICATIONS”, “Delivered prices”, “US Gulf/Tampa - Tampa,” expressed in US$ per metric ton for
anhydrous ammonia. Ifa range of prices is published for a given week, then an arithmetic average of the low
and high prices rounded to three decimal places shall be used. If a price is not published for a given week
within the relevant calendar month then the previous week’s price shall be used.

NG = the arithmetic average price of natural gas expressed in US$ per MMBtu for the month that is one
month immediately previous to the month Product is delivered, as reported by IntercontinentalExchange®,
Inc. (“ICE”) as the “ICE Day Ahead Natural Gas Report” on the web site:
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reportcenter/reports.htm, by selecting “Indices” in the “Category” box,
“ICE OTC” in the “Market” box, “North American Natural Gas” in the “Report” box, “Month Ahead Index”
and “Houston Ship Channel” in the “Hub” box.

(b) If any of the publications specify the monthly price as a range, the reference price for adjusting the price for Product,
will be the average of the high and low published prices, rounded to three decimal places.

(c) Formula Example: For the month of February, 2015, if the price of benzene for January, 2015 is $2.200dollars per
gallon; the price of ammonia, as the average of the weekly prices between December 21, 2014 and January 20, 2015 is
545.000 dollars per metric ton; and, the price of natural gas for January, 2015 is $3.0400 dollars per MMBTU; then:

The price for the Product would be as follows:

P=P, + 229 x BZ + 0.270 x NH3 + 38.0 x NG

= 725 + 229 x 2.200 + 0.270 x 545.000 + 38.0 x 3.0400
= 725 + 503.800 +147.1504+ 115.52

= 1,491 USS/metric ton.

= 0.68 USS$/Ib.

error. No adjustments will be made for (a) any quantities delivered more than ten (10) days prior to the date of any proven measurement confirming such error, or

defect or shortage within such fifteen (15) day period shall constitute an unqualified acceptance of the Product and a waiver by Buyer of all claims with respect thereto.

10 PAYMENT TERMS/CREDIT. (a) Buyer shall pay all invoices, without deduction, in US currency via wire transfer of immediately available funds into a U.S
bank account designated by INVISTA. If the Agreement does not state payment terms, payment shall be received by INVISTA no later than thirty (30) days from the
date of INVISTA's invoice. Delay in payment will result in Buyer being responsible for interest at a rate of one and a half percent (14%) per month compounded
monthly (19.6% per annum), or the maximum rate allowed by Law, whichever is less, on the outstanding amount of any unpaid invoice beginning on the day after the
payment due date. If the payment due date is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday where banks located in the State of New York are authorized or required to be closed,
Buyer shall make such payment on the business day after such due date.

(b) INVISTA makes no assurance or guarantee regarding any amount of credit or the continuation of such credit to Buyer. If INVISTA, in its sole discretion, provides

shipment of Product, and/or (tii) require Performance Assurance at least three (3) days prior to a scheduled Product shipment. Buyer hereby waives written notice of
any such action. “Performance Assurance” means collateral in the form of either cash, letter(s) of credit, guaranty, or other security acceptable to INVISTA in its sole
discretion.

which INVISTA is entitled (whether arising under the Agreement, another agreement, applicable Law, or otherwise) that is exercised by INVISTA.

11 INDICES. (a) For any components of a Product price under the Agreement that are based upon a published index or published quote, or are revised based upon a
change to a published index or published quote, if such index or quote ceases to be published (either temporarily or permanently) or if one party believes, in good faith,
that such published index or published quote does not accurately reflect changes in Seller’s actual monthly costs for the component reported, then it may provide written
notice to the other party to meet to discuss an alternate means of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the price of Product. The parties shall meet promptly after
the date of such notice (in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice) to discuss and attempt to agree upon such an alternative means of
ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to Product price. If the parties fail to agree on the appropriate adjustment to Product price within thirty (30) days of the date of
the original notice, then the price for Product sold thereafter will be calculated, effective as of the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, based upon Seller’s actual
monthly costs as determined by Seller for the component covered by such published index unless and until an alternate means of adjustment is agreed upon in writing
by the parties.

(b) Retroactive Changes to Indices: If, within twelve (12) months from the date of any payment of the Product price under the terms of the Agreement that is based ona
published index or published quote (a) such index or quote on which the Product price was based is retroactively revised by the person publishing such index or quote,
or (b) such publishing person notes an error in the published index or quote used to calculate the Product price and corrects such error, then the party that would benefit
from the revised or corrected index or quote shall have the right to provide written notice to the other party of such revision or correction and to recalculate the Product
price based on the revised or corrected published index or quote. Following such notice and confirmation of the corrected published index or quote, the parties shall,
within thirty (30) days, make the appropriate refund, credit, offset or payment of the difference between the Product price as originally calculated and the recalculated
price based on the revised or corrected published index or quote.

12 LIMITED WARRANTY. INVISTA warrants only, at the time of delivery, that: (a) Product shall conform to the agreed specifications for the specific Product
sold hereunder, and (b) INVISTA will deliver good title to the Product and that the Product shall be delivered free of liens or encumbrances. Buyer acknowledges,

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, INVISTA SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS OF THE PRODUCT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, ANY TRADE USAGE OR DEALING.
ANY DETERMINATION OF THE SUITABILITY OF THE PRODUCT FOR THE USE CONTEMPLATED BY BUYER IS BUYER'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY.

13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND LIMITED REMEDIES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL
EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST OR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST EARNINGS, LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, WHETHER OR NOT BASED UPON NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, IN TORT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE
OF ACTION. FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, THE PRECEDING SENTENCE INCLUDES THOSE INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
REFERENCED IN §2-715 OF THE NEW YORK UCC. Buyer's exclusive remedy against INVISTA for any cause of action under the Agreement, including without
limitation for failure to deliver or delivery of non-conforming Product, is, at INVISTA's option limited to (a) replacement of the non-conforming Product; or (b) refund
to Buyer of the portion of the purchase price paid by Buyer and attributable to such non-conforming or undelivered Product. In no event shall INVISTA's cumulative
liability exceed the price of Product sold which was the direct cause of the alleged loss, damage or injury. IN ANY EVENT, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT THE RETURN OF THE FULL SALES PRICE FOR THAT PRODUCT SOLD WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED LOSS, DAMAGE
OR INJURY WILL PREVENT THE FOREGOING REMEDIES FROM FAILING OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, AND THAT SUCH REMEDY IS FAIR
AND ADEQUATE.

14. DEFAULT. (a) Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each an event of “Default” and the Party committing such Default, the “Defaulting Party” and
the party claiming the Default, the “Non-Defaulting Party”): (i) the failure by Buyer to provide Performance Assurance when due; (11) INVISTA shall not have

(iii) the failure of a Party to perform any other obligation in the Agreement and such failure is not excused or cured within ten (10) days after written notice thereof: (iv)
the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event; (v) the failure of Buyer to timely provide prepayment or Performance Assurance as set forth in Section 10(d) above; or (vi) the
failure by any Performance Assurance provider of Buyer to perform any obligation of such Performance Assurance provider under any document executed and
delivered in connection herewith, then the Non-Defaulting Party, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Defaulting Party, may do any one or more of the
following: (a) suspend performance under the Agreement or any other agreement between Buyer and INVISTA; and/or (b) cancel the Agreement or any other
agreement between Buyer and INVISTA, whereby any and all obligations of the Defaulting Party, including payments or deliveries due, will, at the option of the NonDefaulting Party, become immediately due and payable or deliverable, as applicable.

(b) IF INVISTA suspends performance and withholds Product delivery as permitted above, INVISTA may sell the Product to a third party and deduct from the proceeds
of such sale the purchase price and all reasonable costs resulting from Buyer's default as identified above, including, without limitation, all costs associated with the
transportation (including, without limitation, demurrage and other vessel or shipping related charges), storage, and sale of the Product. The foregoing rights, which
shall include, but not be limited to, specific performance, shall be cumulative and alternative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the NonDefaulting Party may be entitled at Law or in equity. In addition, Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to recover from the Defaulting Party all court costs, attorneys’
fees and expenses incurred by the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with the Defaulting Party's default, and interest on past due amounts at the rate specified in
Section 10(a) hereof. “Bankruptcy Event” means the occurrence of any of the following events with respect to a Party or any Performance Assurance provider for
Buyer: (i) filing of a petition or otherwise commencing, authorizing or acquiescing in the commencement of a proceeding or cause of action under any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar Law, (ii) making of an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; (iii) having a bankruptcy petition filed

assets; or (vi) being generally unable to pay its debts as they fall due.

15 SPECIALTY MANUFACTURED PRODUCT. If the Agreement covers Products that must be manufactured especially for Buyer, and the Agreement is
suspended, terminated or cancelled for any reason, Buyer will take delivery of and make payment for such Products as have been completed and such Products as are in
process on the date notice of suspension, termination or cancellation is received by INVISTA. If Buyer for any reason cannot accept delivery of such Products, Buyer
will make payment therefor as though delivery has been made and INVISTA will store such Products for Buyer's account and at Buyer's expense.

is EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. (a) Force Majeure: The parties will be excused from their respective performances hereunder (except Buyer's payment obligations)
if performance is prevented or delayed by any acts of God, fire, explosion, flood, unusually severe or abnormal weather, riots or other civil disturbances, wars, acts of
terrorism, actions of governments, voluntary or involuntary compliance with any Law or request of any governmental authority, strikes, lockouts or other labor
difficulties, failure of usual sources of raw materials or other sources of supply, failure of computer systems to operate properly, destruction or loss of electronic records
or data, failure of mechanical or chemical function or equipment normally used by INVISTA for manufacturing, handling or delivering of Product, or internally
produced intermediates used in manufacture of any of the Product, plant shutdowns, any necessity to not operate, or to reduce operation of, equipment in order to
protect the safety of people or to protect the environment, or any circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party seeking excuse from performance (“force
majeure”). Promptly after a party determines a force majeure condition exists, that party will notify the other of the circumstances and consequences claimed and will
use reasonable means to remove the cause(s) in question. Neither party will be obligated to settle any demands of, or disputes with, laborers; nor will Buyer be excused
from paying monies due or complying with INVISTA's credit terms. Quantities affected by force majeure will be deleted from the Agreement, but the Agreement will
otherwise continue in full force and effect for the term set forth in the Agreement. In periods of shortage of Product due to force majeure, INVISTA may apportion any
reduced quantity of Product among itself and its customers and affiliates in an equitable manner. INVISTA shall not be required to acquire Product to replenish any
shortfall in Product arising as a result of a force majeure. Should INVISTA acquire any quantity of Product following a force majeure, INVISTA may use or distribute,
without apportioning, such Product at its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, any quantity of Product INVISTA acquires and distributes to any nonaffiliated customers shall be equitably apportioned to all of INVISTA's non-affiliated customers. Under no circumstances will INVISTA be obligated to obtain Product
for delivery hereunder except from its designated source(s) of supply, or if none is so designated by INVISTA, from its usual, customary and/or most recent source(s) of
supply.

(b) Commercial Impracticability: Either party may suspend performance and/or terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, without liability , if for any reason, a
Party shuts down the unit(s), or the manufacturing facility at which Product (or the feedstock for the Product) is made or used, or if a change in circumstances (whether
foreseeable or unforeseeable) causes a Party to incur a loss on a full cost basis at any time on the sale or use of Product hereunder from or in the unit or the
manufacturing facility.

(c) Adverse Impact of Law: All of the terms and provisions of the Agreement are subject to applicable Laws (as defined herein), including, without limitation, all
orders, rules and regulations, of all governmental authorities having or purporting to have jurisdiction. If, at any time after the Effective Date, any such Law should be
amended or proposed to be amended or if new Laws are enacted or proposed to be enacted that would have an adverse economic impact upon INVISTA (including as
examples and without limitation, Laws that would require INVISTA to install anti-pollution equipment, to purchase credits under any cap and trade program or
regulations or in any way alter any manufacturing facility or any part of the facilities or the use of the facilities that are a part of the manufacturing facility) (an
“Adverse Law Impact”), then Buyer shall reimburse INVISTA for its proportionate part of INVISTA’s actual costs incurred as a result of the Adverse Law Impact.

(d) Shortages: If for any reason shortages occur in INVISTA's supply of the goods or products necessary to produce Product, unless Buyer has provided INVISTA with
written notice, and INVISTA agrees in writing, that each source of supply must be a qualified source of supply, INVISTA may, without obligation to Buyer, obtain
similar products from other sources and allocate all such products produced among its customers, its own requirements and the requirements of its divisions,
subsidiaries and affiliates, in a manner and amount that is fair and reasonable. INVISTA may deduct the quantity not shipped because of this allocation from the
quantity under the Agreement without liability to Buyer for failure to deliver. Buyer may purchase from other suppliers any quantity of Product that INVISTA is
unwilling or unable to deliver.

with the Product.

is. SUCCESSOR AND ASSIGNS, The Agreement binds and inures to the benefit of Buyer and INVISTA and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

successor to substantially all of the assets or business to which this Agreement relates, without the other Party’s prior written consent. Any assignment or attempted
assignment in contravention of the foregoing shall be null and void, shall be considered a breach of the Agreement, and shall permit the other Party in addition to any
other rights that it may have, to terminate the Agreement.
