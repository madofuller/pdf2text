ExhibitA
Product Price/Formula

Product Pricing:

Price:

The Selling Price (P) for Product would be determined each calendar month during the period in effect using the following formula,
valid for packaged material perthe appropriate delivery terms for full truckload quantities (minimum 42,500 pounds unless otherwise
authorized by Seller) and forrailcar delivery as applicable.

P=P, + 0.0966 *(BZ)+0.0001 *(NH3+33)+0.0163 *(NG)

Where:

P = the Selling Price for Product in U.S. dollars per pound (rounded to 4 decimal places, $X.XXXX/Ib) forthe current calendar
month. Price may also be shown in US$ permetric toncalculated by multiplying selling price in US$ per pound by 2204.623 and
rounding to the nearest whole dollar ($X,XXX/MT).

P, = the product adder shall be in U.S. dollars per pound (rounded to 4 decimal places, $X.XXXX/Ib) and is defined in the table

below:

0.444

     
         
     

The product adder shall be fixed forthe Initial Term of the contract. The product adder for any Renewal Term shall be as mutually agreed
to in writing by the parties by 180 days prior to the affected Renewal Term year. In the event that the parties do not reach an agreement by the said
date, then the Agreement will automatically terminate at the end of the Initial Term or Renewal Term as applicable. This termination clause shall
supersede any termination periods referenced in the term section of the agreement.

BZ = the U.S. monthly contract benzene price, in US dollars per gallon, as published in IHS Chemical (formerly CMAI) Aromatics
Market Weekly forthemonth that is immediately priorto the month Product is shipped, rounded to three decimal places.

NH3 = the price for ammonia as reported by FERTECON AMMONIA REPORT, under the heading, “FERTECON PRICE

SER VICE”, “AMMONIA PRICE INDICATIONS”, Delivered Prices, “FOB Caribbean”, as thea verage of the weekly prices forthe
calendar month that is two months priorto theshipment month, expressed in US$ per metric ton for anhydrous ammonia, roundedto
three decimal places.

NG = the unrounded NYMEX Henry Hubnatural gas futures closing price on the contractsettlement date, as expressed in US$ per
MMBtu, forthe month that is one month immediately priorto the month Product is shipped.

a) Ifthe benzene, natural gas and/or ammonia publications specify thereference price as a range, the reference price for
adjusting the price for Product, will be the average of the high and low published prices.

Index Integrity: For any components of the Price that arebased upona published index or published quote, orare revised basedupona
change toa published index or published quote, if (i) such index or quote ceases to be published (eithertemporarily or permanently
otherthan due toa change in the index name or publisher), or (ii) either Party believes such published index or published quote does
not accurately reflect INVISTA’s actualm onthly costs forthe component reported (either temporarily or permanently) (each, an
“Index Integrity Trigger Event’), then the applicable Party may provide written noticeto the other Party to meet to discuss an
alternative means of determining such component ofthe Price that was previously determined by such published index or published
quote (the“Index Integrity Notice”). The Parties shallmeet promptly after the date of an Index Integrity Notice (in any eventnot later
than fifteen (15) days after the date ofthe notice)to discuss and attemptto agree upon analtemative means of determining the
relevantcomponent of the Price. The applicable Party shall, prom ptly following the providing of an Index Integrity Notice, provide to
the other Party its suggested alternative published index or published quote or other means of determining the relevant component of
the Price, and the Parties shallthen meet to negotiate the appropriate means of determining such component. If the Parties failto
agree on the appropriate means of determining the relevant component ofthe Price within thirty (30) days ofthe date of the Index
Integrity Notice, then the Price will be calculated, effective as of thefirst of themonth following the month in which the Index
Integrity Trigger Event occurred, based upon INVISTA’s actual monthly costs ofthe relevant component ofthe Price as determined

by INVISTA. The remedies for the Parties’ failure to agree within the thirty (30)-day period provided for in the preceding sentence
sha llremain in effect unless and untilan alternativemeans of adjustment is agreed upon in writing by the Parties.

Pricing Example: The January 2022 Adipic Acid price for Malcom undertheterms in this agreement would be $0. 93 56 per pound
(equivalentto approximately $2,063/MT). Each month a price notification will be sent to Buyer.

Pricing inputs:

P.. = $0. 444/lb, BZ = $3,.280/gallon, NH3 = $826/ton, NG = $5.447/mmbtu
Pricing Calculation:

P ($/mt) = $0,444 + (0.0966*$3.280)+ (0.0001 *($826+33)) + (0.0163*$5.447)
P= $0..9356/lb
