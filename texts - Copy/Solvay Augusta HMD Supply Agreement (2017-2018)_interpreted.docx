third parties’ products on consignment. Seller’s railcars shall be removed from consignment

(a)
(1)

(ii)

Heels.

Seller shall invoice Buyer against the weight shown on bill of lading for each railcar
delivered to Buyer.

Two (2) times per Contract Year, a summary credit or debit invoice shall be issued for
railcar heels. The first heels reconciliation should take place by September 30 of each
Contract Year, and the second heels reconciliation should take place by March 31 of each
Contract Year. The summary invoice shall be created for each railcar delivered during the
previous months by multiplying the Adjusted Weight (as defined below) by 0.9 and by
the unit price of Product during the respective month of shipment in order to determine
the credit/debit amount for each railcar. Positive dollar summary amounts shall be issued
as debit invoices by Seller. Negative dollar summary amounts shall be issued as credit
invoices by Seller. The summary credit or debit memo will be issued within ten (10)
business days of the heels report.

For purposes of determining the weight for a credit or debit invoice, the Seller’s bill of
lading weight is subtracted from Buyer’s offloaded weight and then adjusted as follows

(the “Adjusted Weight”):

(1) If the resulting amount is a negative number, indicating a credit to Buyer, the
credit amount shall be reduced by 0.1 MT to determine the credit amount to
Buyer. Such reduction shall not result in a debit amount to Buyer.

(2) If the resulting amount is a positive number, indicating a debit to Buyer, the debit
amount shall not be reduced by 0.1 MT for determination of the debit to Buyer.

EXAMPLE:

° Seller solution weight 1s 80 tons for all railcars.

. 3 railcars shipped in the Third Quarter of a Calendar Year.
° Third-Quarter price is $2570/ton.

Railcar #1: Buyer offload amount is 78 tons.

Heels calculation railcar #1: ((78 - 80) + 0.1)*0.9*$2570/ton = $-4395 [a
credit amount]

Railcar #2: Buyer offload amount is 82 tons.

Heels calculation railcar #2: (82 - 80)*0.9*$2570 = $4626 [a debit
amount]

Railcar #3: Buyer offload amount is 79.9 tons.

aw’
10.

Heels calculation railcar #3: ((79.9 — 80) + 0.1)*0.9* $2570/ton = $0 [no
credit or debit amount]

TOTAL SUMMARY INVOICE: A debit invoice in the amount of $231 for
heels from shipments during Q3 of that Calendar Year will be combined with any
other heels from Q2 of that Calendar Year to be issued by INVISTA by
September 30 based on the heels report submitted by Solvay.

(iii) The maximum weight discrepancy (Seller’s bill of lading weight subtracted from Buyer’ s
offloaded weight) of any individual railcar shall be 1.500 MT. For weight discrepancies
over this amount, a railcar problem report shall be issued to Seller, an investigation of the
discrepancy shall occur and the discrepancy will be reconciled separately from the
monthly heels reconciliation.

Amendment No. 1, have the meanings ascribed to them in the Sales Agreement.
