PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of January 1, 2022 (the “Effective
Date”), between INVISTA, (“INVISTA”) and Rhodia Brasil S.A. (“Buyer”). INVISTA and Buyer are each
individually referred to as a “Party” and, together, as the “Parties.”

1. Product. The product (“Product”) purchased by Buyer and sold by INVISTA under this Agreement
is Adiponitrile (“ADN”) conforming to the specifications set forth in Exhibit A (the “Specifications”). Buyer will
consume all Product and will not resell, transfer, assign, deliver or otherwise convey Product to any other Person or
location.

 

2. Quantities.

(a) Minimum Quantity. Buyer will order from INVISTA a minimum of 8,000 metric tons of
Product per Contract Year (the “Minimum Annual Quantity”).

(b) Maximum Quantities. INVISTA will have no liability for any failure to confirm, sell or
deliver to Buyer (i) any quantities of Product exceeding (A) 12,000 metric tons of Product per Contract Year (the
“Maximum Annual Quantity”); or (B) the lesser of (x) 1,500 metric tons of Product per month or (y) 120% of the
lesser of the Month 2 and Month 3 forecasted quantities for the month (the lesser of clauses (x) and (y), the “Maximum
Monthly Quantity”); or (1i) the Minimum Annual Quantity arising from INVISTA’s inability to sell or deliver any
quantities of Product exceeding the Maximum Monthly Quantity. INVISTA may, however, elect (in its sole discretion
and without any obligation) to sell and deliver quantities of Product exceeding either the Maximum Annual Quantity
or the Maximum Monthly Quantity at such price and on such terms that are acceptable to INVISTA.

3. INVISTA Facilities. INVISTA may source the Product to be sold under this Agreement from any
manufacturing facility that INVISTA may designate (each, an “INVISTA Facility”).

4, Delivery Terms.

(a) Delivery Point. INVISTA will deliver Product CFR (Incoterms” 2010) Santos (the
“Delivery Point”). INVISTA and Buyer can choose alternative delivery terms if mutually agreed by both parties.

(b) Title and Risk of Loss. Title, together with risk of loss, damage and contamination, to
Product will pass from INVISTA to Buyer upon delivery at the Delivery Point, in accordance with Section 4(a).

(c) Other Delivery Matters. INVISTA may select any reasonable method of delivery without
liability of its selection. The Parties will cooperate to the extent needed to coordinate delivery dates and times.
INVISTA does not guarantee specific delivery dates or times. Buyer will unload Product and promptly release all
transportation equipment. Buyer will be liable for any demurrage and/or expenses from delay. If Buyer fails to unload
all Product, any remaining Product will be deemed to have been abandoned and will become the property of INVISTA.
Buyer will not receive any consideration for any abandoned Product and Buyer will pay any transportation, handling,
and/or storage charges for such Product until it is received and accepted by INVISTA. Buyer will return all returnable
containers, equipment, or packaging (the “Containers”), within 120 days of the invoice, freight collect, and will assume
all other liability with respect to the Containers. INVISTA may transfer title to the Containers to Buyer, if not returned
within 120 days, by invoicing for the established price of the Containers and Buyer will pay such invoice upon receipt.

(d) Minimum Shipment Size. The Minimum Shipment size is 1,000 metric tons per shipment.
If Buyer requests shipments below 1,000 metric tons and INVISTA agrees, INVISTA reserves the right to adjust the
Freight component (F) in Section 6. Price.

(e) Shipping Instructions. Buyer and INVISTA will discuss and mutually agree upon any other
terms of Shipment not defined elsewhere in this agreement.

5. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and will expire at the end of
December 31, 2023 (the “Term”).

6. Price.

(a) The price of the Product (the “Price”) will be equal to an amount determined in accordance
with the following formula (rounded to the nearest 1 decimal point in $/kg, such as

$X.X/kg)

 

Price = P ($/kg) = 0.56 * BD + 0.48 * NH3+ .033 * NG+ Pc+F
Where:

 
BD= Monthly $/kg USGC Butadiene price from IHS (-1)

NH3 = Monthly average of the weekly $/kg Caribbean ammonia prices from Fertecon (-2)
NG= Monthly Henry Hub natural gas index as published by NYMEX (-1)

Pe= $1.1/kg for annual volumes below 8kTa, and $1.075/kg for volumes above 8kTa
F= $0.175/kg

(b) Index Integrity. For any components of the Price that are based upon a published index or
published quote, or are revised based upon a change to a published index or published
quote, if (i) such index or quote ceases to be published (either temporarily or permanently
other than due to a change in the index name or publisher), (ii) either Party believes such
published index or quote no longer reflects the market price for the component reported,
or (ili) INVISTA believes, in good faith, that such published index or published quote does
not accurately reflect changes in INVISTA’s actual monthly costs for the component
reported (either temporarily or permanently) (each, an “Index Integrity Trigger Event”),
then the applicable party may provide written notice to the other party to meet to discuss
an alternate means of ascertaining the appropriate means of determining such component
of the price that was previously determined by such index or published quote (the “Index
Integrity Notice”). The parties shall meet promptly after the date of an Index Integrity
Notice (in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice) to discuss
and attempt to agree upon an alternative means of determining the relevant component to
the Price. Each party shall, promptly following the providing of an Index Integrity Notice,
provide to the other party its suggested alternative index or published quote or other means
of determining the relevant component to the Price, and the parties shall then meet to
negotiate the appropriate means of determining such component. If the parties fail to agree
on the appropriate means of determining the relevant component to the price within thirty
(30) days of the date of the Index Integrity Notice, then the price for Product will be
calculated, effective as of the first of the month following the month in which the Index
Integrity Trigger Event occurred, based upon INVISTA’s actual monthly costs as
determined by INVISTA. If INVISTA provides an Index Integrity Notice based on
INVISTA’s belief that the published quote did not accurately reflect changes in
INVISTA’s actual monthly cost or the market price of the component reported and
INVISTA subsequently believes that the index has resumed reflecting INVISTA’s actual
monthly costs or market price, INVISTA may, upon written notice, commence using such
index instead of INVISTA’s actual monthly costs or weighted average market price to
calculate the Price for Product sold thereafter unless and until either Party provides another
Index Integnty Notice. The remedies for the parties’ failure to agree within the thirty-day
period provided for in the preceding sentence shall remain in effect unless and until an
alternate means of adjustment is agreed upon in writing by the parties.

7s Forecasts and Orders.

(a) Three Month Forecasts. Buyer will provide to INVISTA, in writing and by the 10" day of
each month of the Term, a rolling forecast of its anticipated needs for Product during the immediately following threemonth period (a “Three Month Forecast”; the first month of any Three Month Forecast, “Month 1”; the second month
of any Three Month Forecast, “Month 2”; and the third month of any Three Month Forecast, “Month 3”).

(b) Month 1 Orders. The quantity of Product designated for Month 1 in each Three Month
Forecast will constitute a firm and irrevocable order for Product, binding on Buyer, to be purchased by Buyer from
INVISTA in each Month |. Buyer will order from INVISTA a quantity of Product for Month | (the “Minimum Month
1 Quantity”) equal to at least (1) 80% of the Month 2 forecasted quantities for that same month, and (ii) 70% of the
Month 3 forecasted quantities for that same month. No orders for purchase and delivery in any Month 1 will be final
or binding on INVISTA, unless INVISTA has provided written notice to Buyer that INVISTA has confirmed or
accepted such orders.

8. Reservation Payments and Reliability Credit.

(a) Reservation Payment. If, for any reason other than as set forth in Section 19, Buyer fails
to order at least: (i) the Minimum Annual Quantity of Product in any Contract Year, then INVISTA may invoice
Buyer, and Buyer will pay INVISTA, an amount (an “Annual Reservation Payment”) equal to (A) the difference
between the Minimum Annual Quantity and the actual amount of Product ordered by Buyer for such Contract Year
(the “Actual Annual Orders”), multiplied by (B) $1.1/kg (the “Reservation Price”); or (ii) the Minimum Month 1

: _ 4

(~

 
Quantity of Product in any Month 1, then INVISTA may invoice Buyer, and Buyer will pay INVISTA, an amount (a
“Monthly Reservation Payment”) equal to (A) the difference between the Minimum Month 1 Quantity and the actual
amount of Product ordered by Buyer for such month, multiplied by (B) the Reservation Price.

(b) Reliability Credit. If, for any reason other than as set forth in Section 2(b) or 19 (or as
otherwise excused under this Agreement), INVISTA fails to sell and deliver the Minimum Annual Quantity of Product
in any Contract Year, then INVISTA will credit Buyer, an amount (the “Annual Reliability Credit”) equal to (i) the
lesser of (A) the difference between the Minimum Annual Quantity and the actual amount of Product sold and
delivered by INVISTA (“Actual Annual Sales”) for such Contract Year and (B) the difference between Actual Annual
Orders and the Actual Annual Sales for such Contract Year, multiplied by (ii) the Reservation Price.

(c) Sole and Exclusive Remedies. In the event of Section 8(a)(i), payment by Buyer of the
Annual Reservation Payment will release Buyer from all other liabilities with respect to ordering the Minimum Annual
Quantity of Product and constitute INVISTA’s sole and exclusive remedy for Buyer’s breach of its obligation to order
the Minimum Annual Quantity in any Contract Year. In the event of Section 8(a)(ii), payment by Buyer of the Monthly
Reservation Payment will release Buyer from all other liabilities with respect to ordering the Minimum Month 1
Quantity of Product for that Month | and constitute INVISTA’s sole and exclusive remedy for Buyer’s breach of its
obligation to order the Minimum Month 1 Quantity in that Month 1. In the event of Section 8(b), payment by
INVISTA of the Annual Reliability Credit will release INVISTA from all other liabilities with respect to selling and
delivering the Minimum Annual Quantity and constitute Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy for INVISTA’s failure to
sell and deliver the Minimum Annual Quantity.

9. Invoices, Payment and Credit.

(a) Invoices. INVISTA will provide to Buyer a monthly summary invoice after each month
end for all deliveries made to Buyer during that month.

(b) Payment. Buyer will pay INVISTA in US$ by Electronic Bank Draft before shipment of
Product, with a maturity date of no more than 45 days, drawn on an INVISTA accepted bank or wire transfer of
immediately available funds, into a bank account designated by INVISTA within forty-five days of the date of the
invoice (the “Payment Due Date”). Buyer will be responsible for interest at a rate of 1.5% per month, compounded
monthly, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable Law, whichever is less (the “Default Interest Rate”), on any
outstanding amount still due after the Payment Due Date.

(c) Credit. INVISTA makes no guarantee of credit or the continuation of credit to Buyer. If
INVISTA determines, in its sole discretion, that Buyer’s creditworthiness or future performance is impaired or
unsatisfactory, INVISTA may (i) suspend deliveries of Product, (ii) require cash-in-advance prepayment; and/or
(iil) require Buyer to provide any other collateral (including cash, letter of credit, guaranty or other security) that
INVISTA may request (“Performance Assurance”). Buyer waives written notice of any such action.

(d) Financial Information. If INVISTA requires any Performance Assurance from Buyer, then
Buyer will also provide to INVISTA any or all annual reports containing its and its Performance Assurance provider’s
audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year (most recent accounting period), prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

(e) Set-Off. INVISTA may, upon notice to Buyer, set-off, offset, combine accounts, net dollar
amounts of obligations, exercise right of retention or withholding or similar rights to which INVISTA is entitled (“Setoff’) against any amount that INVISTA owes to Buyer under this Agreement or any other agreement between the
Parties.

10. Taxes and Duties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer will pay all
taxes, duties, tariffs, consular fees, levies, penalties and other charges imposed by any governmental authority (the
“Duties”) with respect to: (a) this Agreement; (b) rejection of Product, and/or (c) the transportation, importation,
exportation, or delivery of the Produce or any raw materials used by Seller to manufacture the Product. If any of the
Duties are paid, or required to be paid by INVISTA, INVISTA will send written notice to Buyer and Buyer will
reimburse INVISTA within 10 days of receipt of notice. INVISTA reserves to itself all applicable duty drawback
allowances and Buyer will provide assistance in connection with same.

11. Measurement. [NVISTA will determine Product quantities using INVISTA’s measurement
equipment at the INVISTA Facility, unless proven to be in error. No adjustments will be made for (a) any
quantities delivered more than 10 days prior to the date of any proven measurement confirming such error, or (b) any
claims for less than 3% of the quantities measured by INVISTA at the INVISTA Facility.

2 So

 
12. Claims. Buyer will inspect delivered Product within 10 days of delivery by INVISTA in accordance
with Section 4(a) and before any change to the original delivered condition of Product. Buyer will notify INVISTA,
in writing, of any Product defect or shortage within 20 days of receipt of Product. If Buyer fails to give written notice
to INVISTA of any Product defect or shortage, or processes the Product, within such 10-day period, then that Product
will be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer and Buyer waives all claims with respect thereto.

13. Product Stewardship. Buyer acknowledges the hazards associated with the Product and assumes
the responsibility of distributing proper information with respect to hazards to human health or human or
environmental safety. If a Material Safety Data Sheet is provided by (“MSDS”) by INVISTA for the Product, Buyer
will advise all of its employees, agents, contractors and customers of the MSDS, and any supplementary MSDS or
written warnings that it may receive from INVISTA. In addition, if Buyer believes or has reason to believe the MSDS
or other information provided by INVISTA is inaccurate or insufficient, Buyer will immediately notify INVISTA so
INVISTA can supplement or correct the information. If Buyer fails to timely provide INVISTA with such notice it
will be deemed a waiver of any and all claims, demands or causes of action arising from or attributable to the Product.

14, Compliance with Laws. The Parties will comply with all applicable laws, treaties, conventions,
directives, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions or decrees of any governmental
authority having jurisdiction (“Laws”) pertaining to the performance of this Agreement, and Buyer will be solely
responsible for compliance with all Laws applicable to the acquisition, handling or use of Product once that Product
has been delivered by INVISTA in accordance with Section 4(a). Buyer will obtain, at its expense, any license or
consent of any government or authority that is required for the acquisition, handling or use of Product and provide
evidence of same to INVISTA on request. Failure to do so will entitle INVISTA to withhold or delay shipment, but
will not entitle Buyer to withhold or delay payment. Any expenses or charges incurred by INVISTA resulting from
such failure will be paid by Buyer within 10 days of receipt of INVISTA’s written request. Buyer will also comply
with all Laws that restrict the sale, supply or delivery of Product to any destination, country, government, entity or
other Person subject to export controls, economic sanctions or restrictive measures (collectively, “Sanctioned
Persons”). In particular, (a) Buyer confirms that Product is not intended for supply to any Sanctioned Persons, or for
use in the production of goods to be directly or indirectly supplied exclusively or predominantly to any Sanctioned
Persons, to extent such supply or use would be in violation of any Law; and (b) Buyer will not directly or indirectly
sell, supply or deliver any Product to (i) any Person that is designated on any government denied or restricted parties
list (including the BIS Denied Persons List, Entity List or Unverified List; the U.S. Treasury Department Office of
Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List; the Consolidated U.N. Security
Council Sanctions List; or the list of persons, groups and entities subject to E.U. financial sanctions or restrictive
measures) (any such Person, a “Designated Person”), or (ii) any Person, of which the majority of the Person’s issued
and outstanding equity interests is owned directly or indirectly by a Designated Person.

 

15. Export compliance. INVISTA undertakes to inform Buyer in writing of the export classification
concerning controlled product and information. INVISTA undertakes to apply to the competent government
authorities, at no cost to the Purchaser, for any export license or governmental authorization necessary to fulfill
INVISTA’s obligations to deliver Product as defined in this agreement. If INVISTA fails to comply with its
respective obligations under this section, Buyer shall have the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days written
notice to INVISTA.

16. Governing Law and Venue for Disputes. All matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement
will be interpreted in accordance with the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. The United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or any subsequently enacted treaty or convention
will not apply or govern this Agreement or the performance thereof or any aspect of any dispute arising therefrom.
Any action or proceeding between the Parties, relating to this Agreement, will be commenced and maintained
exclusively in the state or federal courts in Wilmington, Delaware and each Party submits itself unconditionally and
irrevocably to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. INVISTA, however, reserves the right to take legal action
against Counterparty in any jurisdiction necessary to enforce any judgment rendered in connection with this
Agreement. BOTH PARTIES EACH WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION, CLAIM, OR
PROCEEDING RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT.

17. Limited Warranty. INVISTA warrants only, at the time of delivery and subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Agreement, that (a) Product will conform to the Specifications, and (b) INVISTA delivers to
Buyer good title to Product, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances. Buyer assumes all risk and liability for its
acquisition, handling or use of Product. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING, INVISTA DISCLAIMS ALL

/

 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. ANY DETERMINATION OF THE SUITABILITY OF PRODUCT
FOR THE USE CONTEMPLATED BY BUYER WILL BE BUYER’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, INVISTA makes no representation or warranty with respect to, and assumes no
responsibility for, results obtained or damages incurred in connection with Buyer’s use of technical advice, services
or recommendations from INVISTA.

18. Limitation of Liability and Remedies. INVISTA WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOST
OR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS; LOST EARNINGS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. Buyer’s sole and exclusive
remedy from INVISTA for any cause of action under this Agreement, including for failure to deliver or late delivery
is, at INVISTA’s option, limited exclusively to: (a) for nonconforming Product, either (i) replacement of the
nonconforming Product; or (ti) refund of the portion of the Price paid and attributable to such nonconforming Product,
(b) for undelivered Product, the Annual Reliability Credit and (c) for Product that is delivered late, refund of the Price
attributable to the late-delivered Product (subject to return of the late-delivered Product as a condition of such refund).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, however, INVISTA’s cumulative liability will never exceed the Price of
the ordered Product that was the direct cause of the alleged loss, damage or injury. IN ANY EVENT, THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRICE FOR THE ORDERED PRODUCT THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE
ALLEGED LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY WILL PREVENT THE FOREGOING REMEDIES FROM FAILING
OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, AND THAT SUCH REMEDY IS FAIR AND ADEQUATE.

19, Available Remedies. If Buyer: (a) breaches any of its obligations in this Agreement; or (b) is
subject to any bankruptcy proceeding (including filing a petition or commencing a proceeding or cause of action
under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Law; making an assignment or any general arrangement
for the benefit of creditors; having a bankruptcy petition filed against it and such petition is not withdrawn or dismissed
within 30 days after such filing; becoming bankrupt or insolvent; having a bankruptcy official appointed with respect
to it or any substantial portion of its property or assets; or becoming generally unable to pay its debts as they fall due);
then INVISTA, without prior notice or liability to Buyer, may: (w) suspend its performance under, or terminate, this
Agreement; (x) cause any and all obligations of Buyer (including payments or deliveries due) to become immediately
due or deliverable; (y) Set-off against any amount that INVISTA owes to Buyer under this Agreement or any other
agreement between the Parties; and/or (z) seek any other rights or remedies to which INVISTA may be entitled. If
INVISTA suspends performance under this Agreement and any Product otherwise designated for delivery to Buyer
can be sold to a third party, then INVISTA will be entitled to sell such Product to such third party, without prior notice
or liability to Buyer. These rights will be cumulative and alternative and in addition to any other rights or remedies
to which INVISTA may be entitled. Buyer will pay all expenses incurred by INVISTA in connection with Buyer's
default, and the Default Interest Rate will accrue on all such expenses incurred by INVISTA.

20. Excused Performance.

a. Performance Excuses. Each Party will be excused from performing its obligations under
this Agreement (except Buyer’s payment obligations), without liability to the other Party, if performance is prevented
or delayed by (i) any fire, explosion, flood, unusually severe or abnormal weather, riot or other civil disturbance, war,
act of terrorism, or action of government; (ii) voluntary or involuntary compliance with any Law or request of any
governmental authority; (111) any strike, lockout or other labor difficulty; (iv) any failure of usual sources of raw
materials or other sources of supply for Product; (v) any unavailability of or interference with the usual means of
transporting Product (or the raw materials for Product); (vi) any failure of computer systems to operate properly;
(vii) any destruction or loss of electronic records or data; (viii) any failure of mechanical function or chemical process
or equipment used in manufacturing, handling or delivering Product, or any raw material used in manufacturing
Product; (ix) any unit, facility or site shutdown; (x) any necessity to not operate, or to reduce operation of, equipment
in order to protect the safety of people or to protect the environment; or (xi) any force majeure event or other
circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the Party seeking excuse from performance (each of clauses (i) through
(xi), a “Performance Excuse”). If a Party determines that a Performance Excuse exists, then the Party will notify the
other of the circumstances and consequences claimed and will use commercially reasonable means to remove the
cause or causes in question. No Party, however, will be obligated to settle any demands of, or disputes with, laborers.
Buyer will not be excused from paying monies due or complying with INVISTA’s credit terms. Quantities of Product
affected by a Performance Excuse will be deleted from this Agreement, but this Agreement and each Party’s
obligations will otherwise continue in full force and effect for the Term with respect to all quantities of Product not
affected by a Performance Excuse. In periods of shortage of Product due to a Performance Excuse, INVISTA may
apportion, in an equitable manner, any remaining INVISTA inventory of Product available to INVISTA from the units
and facilities affected by the Performance Excuse (excluding, all reserved, committed, in-transit, delivered or
consigned inventory) among its customers, its Affiliates and itself. INVISTA will not be required to obtain Product

nO

 
to replenish any shortage of Product arising as a result of a Performance Excuse. If INVISTA acquires any quantity
of Product following a Performance Excuse, then INVISTA may use, distribute or allocate, without apportioning, such
Product in its sole discretion.

b. Commercial Impracticability or Hardship. INVISTA also will be excused from performing
its obligations under, and may, upon notice to Buyer, suspend its performance or terminate this Agreement, in whole
or in part, without liability to Buyer if, for any reason: (i) any of the units, facilities or sites at which Product (or the
feedstock for Product) is made shuts down; or (ii) INVISTA incurs a loss on a full cost basis on the sale of Product
under this Agreement.

21. Adverse Impact of Law. If, at any time after the Effective Date, any applicable Laws are amended
imposed, or enacted, or proposed to be amended, imposed, or enacted, that would have an adverse economic impact
upon INVISTA (including any Laws that would cause INVISTA to bear the costs of installing antipollution equipment
or in any way alter, or alter the use of, any INVISTA Facility or any facility used to produce raw materials used to
make the Product or imposes or increases a duty, tariff, surcharge, or other similar tax on the Product or any raw
material used to make the Product) (an “Adverse Law Impact”), Buyer will reimburse INVISTA for all actual costs
incurred by INVISTA as a result of the Adverse Law Impact.

a, Confidentiality. For a period of one year following the expiration or termination of this Agreement,
Buyer will treat as confidential the terms of this Agreement and all Product information (including the Specifications
and information on the handling, storage, loading and unloading of Product) supplied by INVISTA (the “Confidential
Information”), limit its use of Confidential Information solely to the performance of this Agreement, and not disclose
the Confidential Information to any other Person, except those of its employees who have a need to know and are
necessary to Buyer’s performance of this Agreement. Buyer will, upon request, expiration or termination of this
Agreement, promptly retum to INVISTA all Confidential Information, and destroy any and all material containing
Confidential Information.

23. Trademarks. Buyer will not use a trademark or trade name of INVISTA or any of its Affiliates.

24. Successor and Assigns. This Agreement binds and inures to the benefit of all Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Buyer will not assign any interest in, nor delegate any obligation under
this Agreement without INVISTA’s prior written consent. Any assignment or attempted assignment in contravention
of the foregoing will be null and void, will be considered a breach of this Agreement, and INVISTA may, in addition
to any other rights it has, terminate this Agreement.

25. Entire Agreement, Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement embodies the entire understanding
between the Parties. The English version of this Agreement is the governing version; any translation of this Agreement
is nonbinding. Waiver by any Party of any breach of the terms of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of
any other breach. Any provision of this Agreement found to be invalid or unenforceable will not affect the validity
or enforceability of its other provisions. The terms of this Agreement can only be modified in a future amendment
executed by all Parties that: (a) specifically refers to this Agreement; (b) specifically identifies the term amended; and
(c) is signed by duly authorized representatives of all Parties.
