Amendment of Appendix II (Product Pricing and Pricing Changes). Appendix Il of the
Sales Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced as follows:

(a) Price: The Selling Price (P) for Product will be determined each calendar month, with
a pricing sheet accompanying the monthly price notification. The Selling Price will
be determined using the following formula:

P = Pc + 229 *(BZ) + 0.27 *(NH3+33) + 38 *(NG)

Where:
P = the Selling Price for Product in U.S. dollars per metric ton (rounded to
the nearest whole $) for the current calendar month.

Pe = US$ 800 per metric ton

BZ = the U.S. monthly contract benzene price, in US dollars per gallon,
as published in IHS Chemical (formerly CMAI) Aromatics Market
Weekly for the month immediately preceding the month product is
shipped, unrounded.

NH = the monthly average, rounded to two decimal places, of the
weekly Caribbean, fob, ammonia prices for the month two months prior
to the month product is shipped, for each week that falls within the
relevant calendar month, as published in the weekly “FERTECON
AMMONIA REPORT”, under the headings, “FERTECON PRICE
SERVICE”, “AMMONIA PRICE INDICATIONS”, “FOB PRICES”,
“CARIBBEAN”, expressed in US$ per metric ton for anhydrous
ammonia. If a range of prices is published for a given week, then an
arithmetic average of the low and high prices (unrounded) shall be used.
If a price is not published for a given week within the relevant calendar
month then the previous week’s price shall be used.

NG = The unrounded NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures closing
price on the contract settlement date, as expressed in US$ per MMBtu, for
the month Product is shipped.

(b) If the benzene, natural gas and/or ammonia publications specify the price
as a range, the reference price for adjusting the price for Product, will be
the average of the high and low published prices,

(c) Pricing Example: The October 2020 Adipic Acid price for Bulk Trucks
(delivered to Buyer’s facility) under the terms proposed in this agreement
would be $1,306/metric ton ($0.592/Ib).

Tier | Pricing Example Inputs:
Po = $800/ton BZ = $1.54/gallon, NH3 = $171.75/ton, NG =
$2.57/mmbtu

Tier 1 Pricing Example Calculation:

P S/mt) = $700 + (229*$1.54) + (0.27*($171.75+33)) + (38*$2,57)
P = $800 + 352.66 + 55.28 + 98.00

P = $1,306/mt (approximately $0.592/Ib)”

(g) Certain Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined in this
Amendment No. 3, have the meanings ascribed to them in the Sales Agreement.
