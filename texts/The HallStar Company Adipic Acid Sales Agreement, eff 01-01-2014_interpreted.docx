Appendix IT
Product Pricing

(a) Price: The Selling Price (P) for Product will be determined each calendar month that this Agreement is in effect using
the following formula:

P= Pe + 229 x BZ + 0.270 x NH3 + 38.0 x NG

Where:

P = the selling price for Product in US$ per metric ton for the current calendar month, rounded to the nearest

whole dollar. Price may also be shown in US$ per Ib calculated by dividing selling price in US$ per metric ton by

2204.623 and rounding to two decimal places.

Pc Tier 1: 0 —-3,400mt = 615 US$/metric ton
Pc Tier 2: 3,401 — 4,500mt = 500 US$/metric ton

BZ = the North America Benzene Contract price for the month that is one month immediately previous to the
month Product is delivered, expressed in US cents per gallon (¢/gal) FOB US Gulf Coast, converted to
US$/gal, as published in the CMAI Market Advisory Services Market Reports “Aromatics Market Advisory
Service — North America”, applicable “Market Weekly Issue”, “Aromatics Market Report”, under the
heading, “United States”, “Benzene”, “Contract”, “Cents/Lb.” If more than one price is published in any
month, the Benzene price for that month will be the arithmetic average of the published prices for the month
rounded to three decimal places.

NH3 = the monthly average, rounded to three decimal places, of the weekly Tampa ammonia prices, as the
average of the weekly prices published from the 21 of the month two months prior to the current
month to the 20" of the month immediately preceding the current month, as published in the weekly
FERTECON AMMONIA REPORT, under the headings, ‘FERTECON PRICE SERVICE”, “AMMONIA
PRICE INDICATIONS”, “Delivered prices”, “US Gulf/Tampa - Tampa,” expressed in US$ per metric ton for
anhydrous ammonia. If a range of prices is published for a given week, then an arithmetic average of the low
and high prices rounded to three decimal places shall be used. If a price is not published for a given week
within the relevant calendar month then the previous week’s price shall be used.

NG = the arithmetic average price of natural gas expressed in US$ per MMBtu for the month that is one
month immediately previous to the month Product is delivered, as reported by IntercontinentalExchange®,
Inc. (“ICE”) as the “ICE Day Ahead Natural Gas Report” on the web site:
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reportcenter/reports.htm, by selecting “Indices” in the “Category” box,
“ICE OTC” in the “Market” box, “North American Natural Gas” in the “Report” box, “Month Ahead Index”
and “Houston Ship Channel” in the “Hub” box.

(b) If any of the publications specify the monthly price as a range, the reference price for adjusting the price for Product,
will be the average of the high and low published prices, rounded to three decimal places.

(c) Formula Example: For the month of January, 2012, if the price of benzene for December, 2011 is $3.280 dollars per
gallon; the price of ammonia, as the average of the weekly prices between November 21 and December 20, 2011 is
460.000 dollars per metric ton; and, the price of natural gas for December, 2011 is $4.2182 dollars per MMBTU; then:

The price for the Product would be as follows:

P= Pc + 229 x BZ + 0.270 x NH3 + 38.0 x NG

= 615 + 229 x 3.280 + 0.270 x 460.000 + 38.0 x 4.2182
= 615 + 751.120 +124.200 + 160.292

= 1,651 US$/metric ton.

=0.75 US$/Ib.

improper advantage.

(e) If any license or consent of any government or other authority is required for the acquisition, carriage or Use of Product by Buyer, Buyer will obtain the same at its
expense, and if necessary, provide evidence of the same to INVISTA on request. Failure to do so will entitle INVISTA to withhold or delay shipment, but failure to do

by Buyer within ten (10) days of receipt of INVISTA's written request.

(f) Except as permitted under U.S. Laws, Product will not be sold, supplied or delivered by the Buyer directly or indirectly to any party or destination that, at the time of

Within two (2) days after INVISTA's request, Buyer will provide INVISTA with appropriate documentation to verify the final destination of any Product delivered
hereunder.

7 UNLOADING AND CONTAINERS. Buyer will unload and release all transportation equipment promptly so that no demurrage or other expense or loss resulting

containers or packaging, freight collect. Buyer shall assume all other liability, including, without limitation, demurrage, with respect to such returnable containers and

8 MEASUREMENT. Product quantities will be determined by INVISTA's measurement equipment at INVISTA's designated shipping point, unless proven to be in
error. No adjustments will be made for (a) any quantities delivered more than ten (10) days prior to the date of any proven measurement confirming such error, or (b)
any Claims for less than three percent (3%) of the quantities measured by INVISTA at the shipping point. Product quality shall be governed by a sample of Product
taken by INVISTA at INVISTA's designated shipping point.

9 CLAIMS. Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, inspect Product delivered hereunder immediately after receipt. Within ten (10) days of Buyer's receipt of
Product and before the use, disposition, processing, admixture, reaction or other change from the original condition of any part of the Product (except for reasonable test
and inspection quantities), Buyer shall notify INVISTA in writing if Product is found defective or short in any respect. Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees that
it must test the compatibility of any fiber Products prior to any Use of fiber Products if the fiber merge number or other identifier differs from that designated in
previous shipments. Any Use of any of Product (except for reasonable tests and inspection quantities) or Buyer's failure to give written notice to INVISTA of such
defect or shortage within such ten (10) day period shall constitute an unqualified acceptance of the Product and a waiver by Buyer of all claims with respect thereto.

10 PAYMENT TERMS/CREDIT. (a) Buyer shall pay all invoices, without deduction, in US currency via wire transfer of immediately available funds into a U.S.
bank account designated by INVISTA. If the Agreement does not state payment terms, payment shall be received by INVISTA no later than thirty (30) days from the
date of INVISTA's invoice. Delay in payment will result in Buyer being responsible for interest at a rate of one and a half percent (12%) per month compounded
monthly (19.6% per annum), or the maximum rate allowed by Law, whichever is less, on the outstanding amount of any unpaid invoice beginning on the day after the
payment due date. If the payment due date is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday where banks located in the State of New York are authorized or required to be closed,
Buyer shall make such payment on the business day after such due date.

(b) INVISTA makes no assurance or guarantee regarding any amount of credit or the continuation of such credit to Buyer. If INVISTA, in its sole discretion, provides
Buyer with a line of credit to facilitate purchases of Product from INVISTA under the Agreement, such credit line may be amended, decreased or terminated at any time
at INVISTA's sole discretion.

(c) If any such credit provided to Buyer, or Performance Assurance is required by INVISTA of Buyer, Buyer will provide to INVISTA any or all annual reports
containing Buyer's and/or the Buyer's Performance Assurance provider's audited consolidated financial statements for a particular fiscal year. In all cases, the
statements shall be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if INVISTA determines, in its sole discretion, that the creditworthiness or future performance of Buyer is impaired or unsatisfactory,
INVISTA may (i) suspend deliveries of Product, (ii) require prepayment by wire transfer of immediately available funds at least three (3) days prior to a scheduled
shipment of Product, and/or (iii) require Performance Assurance at least three (3) days prior to a scheduled Product shipment. Buyer hereby waives written notice of
any such action. "Performance Assurance” means collateral in the form of either cash, letter(s) of credit, guaranty, or other security acceptable to INVISTA in its sole
discretion.

(e) INVISTA reserves the right, at any time, to Set-off against any amount that INVISTA owes to Buyer under the Agreement or any other agreement between such
parties. "Set-off" means set-off, offset, combination of accounts, netting of dollar amounts of monetary obligations, right of retention or withholding or similar right to
which INVISTA is entitled (whether arising under the Agreement, another agreement, applicable Law, or otherwise) that is exercised by INVISTA.

it INDICES. (a) For any components of a Product price under the Agreement that are based upon a published index or published quote, or are revised based upon a
change to a published index or published quote, if such index or quote ceases to be published (either temporarily or permanently) or if one party believes, in good faith,
that such published index or published quote does not accurately reflect changes in Seller’s actual monthly costs for the component reported, then it may provide written
notice to the other party to meet to discuss an alternate means of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the price of Product. The parties shall meet promptly after
the date of such notice (in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice) to discuss and attempt to agree upon such an alternative means of
ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to Product price. If the parties fail to agree on the appropriate adjustment to Product price within thirty (30) days of the date of
the original notice, then the price for Product sold thereafter will be calculated, effective as of the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, based upon Seller’s actual
monthly costs as determined by Seller for the component covered by such published index unless and until an alternate means of adjustment is agreed upon in writing
by the parties.

(b) Retroactive Changes to Indices: If, within twelve (12) months from the date of any payment of the Product price under the terms of the Agreement that is based on a
published index or published quote (a) such index or quote on which the Product price was based is retroactively revised by the person publishing such index or quote,
or (b) such publishing person notes an error in the published index or quote used to calculate the Product price and corrects such error, then the party that would benefit

7

The HallStar Company / INVISTA Confidential
from the revised or corrected index or quote shall have the right to provide written notice to the other party of such revision or correction and to recalculate the Product
price based on the revised or corrected published index or quote. Following such notice and confirmation of the corrected published index or quote, the parties shall,
within thirty (30) days, make the appropriate refund, credit, offset or payment of the difference between the Product price as originally calculated and the recalculated
price based on the revised or corrected published index or quote.

12 LIMITED WARRANTY. INVISTA warrants only, at the time of delivery, that: (a) Product shall conform to INVISTA's then current specifications for the specific
Product sold hereunder, and (b) INVISTA will deliver good title to the Product and that the Product shall be delivered free of liens or encumbrances. Buyer
acknowledges, represents, and warrants that is has all necessary expertise and knowledge in the intended Use of Product sold hereunder and any Use or other product or
material made therefrom, assumes all risk and liability for results obtained by the Use of Product, whether Used singly or in combination with other substances or in any
process. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, INVISTA SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE PRODUCT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, ANY TRADE
USAGE OR DEALING. ANY DETERMINATION OF THE SUITABILITY OF THE PRODUCT FOR THE USE CONTEMPLATED BY BUYER IS BUYER'S
SOLE RESPONSIBILITY.

13 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND LIMITED REMEDIES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL
INVISTA BE LIABLE TO BUYER FOR ANY LOST OR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST EARNINGS, LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WHETHER OR
NOT BASED UPON INVISTA'S NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, IN TORT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION. FOR THE
SAKE OF CLARITY, THE PRECEDING SENTENCE INCLUDES THOSE INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES REFERENCED IN §2-715 OF
THE NEW YORK UCC. Buyer's exclusive remedy against INVISTA for any cause of action under the Agreement, including without limitation for failure to deliver or
delivery of non-conforming Product, is, at INVISTA's option limited to (a) replacement of the non-conforming Product; or (b) refund to Buyer of the portion of the
purchase price paid by Buyer and attributable to such non-conforming or undelivered Product. In no event shall INVISTA's cumulative liability exceed the price of
Product sold which was the direct cause of the alleged loss, damage or injury. IN ANY EVENT, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE RETURN
OF THE FULL SALES PRICE FOR THAT PRODUCT SOLD WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY WILL PREVENT
THE FOREGOING REMEDIES FROM FAILING OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, AND THAT SUCH REMEDY IS FAIR AND ADEQUATE.

14 DEFAULT. (a) Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each an event of “Default” and the Party committing such Default, the “Defaulting Party” and
the party claiming the Default, the “Non-Defaulting Party”): (i) the failure by Buyer to provide Performance Assurance when due; (ii) INVISTA shall not have
received a payment due from Buyer hereunder by the date such payment is due under the Agreement, and such failure shall remain uncured for a period of two (2) days;
(iil) the failure of a Party to perform any other obligation in the Agreement and such failure is not excused or cured within ten (10) days after written notice thereof: (iv)
the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event; (v) the failure of Buyer to timely provide prepayment or Performance Assurance as set forth in Section 10(d) above; or (vi) the
failure by any Performance Assurance provider of Buyer to perform any obligation of such Performance Assurance provider under any document executed and
delivered in connection herewith, then the Non-Defaulting Party, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Defaulting Party, may do any one or more of the
following: (a) suspend performance under the Agreement or any other agreement between Buyer and INVISTA; and/or (b) cancel the Agreement or any other
agreement between Buyer and INVISTA, whereby any and all obligations of the Defaulting Party, including payments or deliveries due, will, at the option of the NonDefaulting Party, become immediately due and payable or deliverable, as applicable.

(b)_ If INVISTA suspends performance and withholds Product delivery as permitted above, INVISTA may sell the Product to a third party and deduct from the
proceeds of such sale the purchase price and all reasonable costs resulting from Buyer's default as identified above, including, without limitation, all costs associated
with the transportation (including, without limitation, demurrage and other vessel or shipping related charges), storage, and sale of the Product. The foregoing rights,
which shall include, but not be limited to, specific performance, shall be cumulative and alternative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the NonDefaulting Party may be entitled at Law or in equity. In addition, Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to recover from the Defaulting Party all court costs, attorneys’
fees and expenses incurred by the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with the Defaulting Party's default, and interest on past due amounts at the rate specified in
Section 10(a) hereof. "Bankruptcy Event" means the occurrence of any of the following events with respect to a Party or any Performance Assurance provider for
Buyer: (i) filing of a petition or otherwise commencing, authorizing or acquiescing in the commencement of a proceeding or cause of action under any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar Law; (ii) making of an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; (iii) having a bankruptcy petition filed
against it and such petition is not withdrawn or dismissed within thirty (30) days after such filing; (iv) otherwise becoming bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced);
(v) having a liquidator, administrator, custodian, receiver, trustee, conservator or similar official appointed with respect to it or any substantial portion of its property or
assets; or (vi) being generally unable to pay its debts as they fall due.

is PATENT INFRINGEMENT ARISING FROM PRODUCT USE. Buyer expressly assumes the risk of and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to
indemnify, defend, and hold the Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Claims for patent infringement by reason of Buyer's Use of Product provided
hereunder, whether used singly or in combination with other product or material, or in the operation of any process.

16 SPECIALTY MANUFACTURED PRODUCT. If the Agreement covers Products that must be manufactured especially for Buyer, and the Agreement is
suspended, terminated or cancelled for any reason, Buyer will take delivery of and make payment for such Products as have been completed and such Products as are in
process on the date notice of suspension, termination or cancellation is received by INVISTA. If Buyer for any reason cannot accept delivery of such Products, Buyer
will make payment therefor as though delivery has been made and INVISTA will store such Products for Buyer's account and at Buyer's expense.

17 EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. (c) Force Majeure: The parties will be excused from their respective performances hereunder (except Buyer's payment
obligations) if performance is prevented or delayed by any acts of God, fire, explosion, flood, unusually severe or abnormal weather, riots or other civil disturbances,
wars, acts of terrorism, actions of governments, voluntary or involuntary compliance with any Law or request of any governmental authority, strikes, lockouts or other
labor difficulties, failure of usual sources of raw materials or other sources of supply, failure of computer systems to operate properly, destruction or loss of electronic
records or data, failure of mechanical or chemical function or equipment normally used by INVISTA for manufacturing, handling or delivering of Product, or internally
produced intermediates used in manufacture of any of the Product, plant shutdowns, any necessity to not operate, or to reduce operation of, equipment in order to
protect the safety of people or to protect the environment, or any circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party seeking excuse from performance ("force
majeure"). Promptly after a party determines a force majeure condition exists, that party will notify the other of the circumstances and consequences claimed and will
use reasonable means to remove the cause(s) in question. Neither party will be obligated to settle any demands of, or disputes with, laborers; nor will Buyer be excused
from paying monies due or complying with INVISTA's credit terms. Quantities affected by force majeure will be deleted from the Agreement, but the Agreement will
otherwise continue in full force and effect for the term set forth in the Agreement. In periods of shortage of Product due to force majeure, INVISTA may apportion any
reduced quantity of Product among itself and its customers and affiliates in an equitable manner. INVISTA shall not be required to acquire Product to replenish any
shortfall in Product arising as a result of a force majeure. Should INVISTA acquire any quantity of Product following a force majeure, INVISTA may use or distribute,
without apportioning, such Product at its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, any quantity of Product INVISTA acquires and distributes to any nonaffiliated customers shall be equitably apportioned to all of INVISTA's non-affiliated customers. Under no circumstances will INVISTA be obligated to obtain Product
for delivery hereunder except from its designated source(s) of supply, or if none is so designated by INVISTA, from its usual, customary and/or most recent source(s) of
supply.

(4) Commercial Impracticability: INVISTA may suspend performance and/or terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, without liability to Buyer, if for any reason,
INVISTA shuts down the unit(s), or the manufacturing facility at which Product (or the feedstock for the Product) is made, or if a change in circumstances (whether
foreseeable or unforeseeable) causes INVISTA to incur a loss on a full cost basis at any time on the sale of Product hereunder from the unit or the manufacturing
facility.

(e) Adverse Impact of Law: All of the terms and provisions of the Agreement are subject to applicable Laws (as defined herein), including, without limitation, all
orders, rules and regulations, of all governmental authorities having or purporting to have jurisdiction. If, at any time after the Effective Date, any such Law should be
amended or proposed to be amended or if new Laws are enacted or proposed to be enacted that would have an adverse economic impact upon INVISTA (including as
examples and without limitation, Laws that would require INVISTA to install anti-pollution equipment, to purchase credits under any cap and trade program or
regulations or in any way alter any manufacturing facility or any part of the facilities or the use of the facilities that are a part of the manufacturing facility) (an
“Adverse Law Impact”), then Buyer shall reimburse INVISTA for its proportionate part of INVISTA’s actual costs incurred as a result of the Adverse Law Impact.

(f) Shortages: If for any reason shortages occur in INVISTA's supply of the goods or products necessary to produce Product, unless Buyer has provided INVISTA with
written notice, and INVISTA agrees in writing, that each source of supply must be a qualified source of supply, INVISTA may, without obligation to Buyer, obtain
similar products from other sources and allocate all such products produced among its customers, its own requirements and the requirements of its divisions,
subsidiaries and affiliates, in a manner and amount that is fair and reasonable. INVISTA may deduct the quantity not shipped because of this allocation from the
quantity under the Agreement without liability to Buyer for failure to deliver.

18 CONFIDENTIALITY. Buyer agrees to treat as confidential all information supplied by INVISTA, and not in the public domain, in connection with the
Agreement, including, but not limited to: specifications, drawings, blueprints, and other technical, business or sales data, including this Agreement and any of its terms,
or statements of work (collectively referred to as the "Confidential Information"). Buyer agrees to (i) keep the Confidential Information confidential and not disclose it
to any third party, (ii) use Confidential Information only as necessary for the performance of the Agreement, and (iii) limit the disclosure of the Confidential

and all copies that were reproduced, and send written confirmation to INVISTA certifying such destruction.

19 TRADEMARKS. Except as may be contained in a separate trademark license, the sale of Product (even if accompanied by documents using a trademark or trade
name) does not convey a license, express or implied, to use any trademark or trade name and Buyer shall not use a trademark or trade name of INVISTA's in connection
with the Product.

20 SUCCESSOR AND ASSIGNS. The Agreement binds and inures to the benefit of Buyer and INVISTA and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Buyer may not assign any interest in, nor delegate any obligation under the Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without INVISTA's prior written consent.
Any assignment or attempted assignment in contravention of the foregoing shall be null and void, shall be considered a breach of the Agreement, and shall permit
INVISTA, in addition to any other rights that it may have, to terminate the Agreement.

International Sale of Goods or any subsequently enacted treaty or convention shall not apply or govern the Agreement or the performance thereof or any aspect of any
dispute arising therefrom. Any action or proceeding between Buyer and INVISTA relating to the Agreement shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in the
state or federal courts in Wilmington, Delaware, and Buyer submits itself unconditionally and irrevocably to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. BUYER AND
INVISTA EACH WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT.

22 AMENDMENT. No salesperson is authorized to bind INVISTA; orders placed with a salesperson are not binding on INVISTA until confirmed in writing by
INVISTA's authorized employee. All technical advice, services and recommendations by INVISTA are intended for use by persons having skill and know-how, and are
accepted by Buyer at its own risk and [NVISTA assumes no responsibility for results obtained or damages incurred from their use. No statements or agreements, oral
or written, not contained herein or in a future amendment hereto executed by both parties will vary or modify the terms hereof. Neither party shall claim any
amendment, modification or release of any provisions hereof unless the same is in writing and such writing: (i) specifically refers to the Agreement; (ii) specifically
identifies the term amended; and (iii) is signed by duly authorized representatives of INVISTA and Buyer.

23 NOTICES. All notices, consents, communications or transmittals under the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed received on the day of delivery if
delivered by hand, by nationally recognized overnight courier or delivery service, or by facsimile (with written confirmation of the completed transmittal); or within
three (3) business days if mailed by United States mail as certified or registered mail with return receipt, postage prepaid, addressed to the party to whom such notice is
given at the address of such party stated in the Sales Agreement.

herein as parties to any other similar legal relationship with respect to the transactions contemplated under the Agreement or otherwise, and no fiduciary, trust or
advisor relationship, nor any other relationship, imposing vicarious liability shall exist between the parties under the Agreement or otherwise at Law.

convenience only and shall not be used in defining or construction of any of the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Waiver by either party of any breach of the
terms and conditions contained herein will not be construed as a waiver of any other or continuing breach. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of its other provisions. If the Agreement is a requirements contract or a partial requirements contract or a
consignment agreement, or if rebates are to be paid, Buyer shall maintain books and records sufficient to document and verify Buyer's purchase obligations and history
and shall permit Seller, during normal business hours, to audit those books and records. No course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade shall be
considered in the interpretation or enforcement of the Agreement.
