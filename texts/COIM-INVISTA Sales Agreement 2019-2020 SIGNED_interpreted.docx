Contract Term (“Term”):

The term of this Agreement commences on January 1, 2019 and will continue up to and including December 31, 2020 (the “Contract Term’).
The Parties may extend this agreement for additional 12 month Terms (the “Renewal Terms”), by either party providing to the other party, no
later than ninety (90) calendar days before the expiry of the then-current Term, written notice of that Party’s desire to extend the term of the
Agreement, which is subject to the other Party’s written agreement, due no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the extension
notice. Together, the initial Contract Term and any Renewal Terms, if exercised by the parties, is referred to as the “Term.”

Contract Volume:

During the Term of this Agreement, Buyer shall order and purchase from Seller and Seller shal] sell and deliver to Buyer the quantity of
Product set forth below:

     
 
   
   

Contract Volume

Minimum Annual Purchase Obligation: 8,000 metric tons
Maximum Annual Supply Obligation: 10,000 metric tons
Maximum Monthly Supply Obligation: 800 metric tons

Timeframe

 

 
 

| January 1, 2019 —
| December 31, 2020

 

 

Contract Volume requested in 1000kg bags or bulk trucks shall be considered Non-Railcar Volume (‘‘Non-Railcar Volume”). Unless mutually
agreed in writing, in any calendar month, the maximum Non-Railcar Volume is 160 metric tons (approximately 8 full truckloads). If Buyer
requests Non-Railcar Volume, Seller has sole option to supply the volume in either bulk trucks or 1000kg bags.

Buyer shall purchase and receive Product, and Seller shall produce and sell Product, in quantities no less than the minimums and no
more than the maximums set forth above during the Term. For purposes of this Agreement, “Month” and “Monthly” shall be considered
a calendar month and “Year” and “Yearly” shall be considered a twelve-consecutive month calendar year beginning January | and

ending December 31.

Purchase orders placed by Buyer are subject to individual acceptance by Seller.
INVISTA CONFIDENTIAL

Spot Volume:

Notwithstanding the Maximum Annual Supply Obligation and the Maximum Monthly Supply Obligation above, if in any month during
the Term Buyer’s requirements exceed the Maximum Monthly Supply Obligation and Buyer wishes to purchase additional Product from
Seller or Seller wishes to sell additional Product to Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall work together in good faith to attempt to agree on a
basis for Seller to sell and Buyer to purchase spot volumes of Product (“Spot Volume”) at a price and quantity and delivery schedule
mutually acceptable to the parties but otherwise under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For clarity, such Spot Volume can be
sold at a price that may be different than the price calculated under this Agreement for the quantities within the Maximum Monthly
Supply Obligation sold and delivered within the same month of delivery. Seller shall report to Buyer aggregate Contract Volume and
Spot Volume on a monthly basis during the Term, and Buyer will confirm such reports.

Lead Time and Forecasting:
Individual purchase orders shall be placed twenty calendar days in advance of requested delivery date for truck deliveries, and placed 30
calendar days in advance of delivery date for railcar deliveries.

By the 10" day of each calendar month during the Term, Buyer shall provide Seller with a forecast of its projected purchase volume of
Product for the subsequent three-month period (each, a “3-Month Rolling Forecast’). Month | of the 3-Month Rolling Forecast shall
represent a binding and irrevocable order to purchase the amount stated in the forecast for that month, plus or minus 25% of Product
volume. Months 2 of the 3-Month Rolling Forecast and Month 3 of the 3-Month Rolling Forecast shall represent a non-binding rolling
estimate of Buyer’s adipic acid requirements.

Shortfall Payment:
If Buyer fails to purchase at least the Minimum Annual Purchase Obligation within the March 31 of the following year in which the

shortfall occurred, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount (the “Shortfall Payment”) equal to the Minimum Annual Purchase Obligation, less
(i) the quantity of Product that Seller fails to deliver in accordance with, or Buyer is validly permitted to not accept for delivery under,
this Agreement (including, without limitation, adipic acid that does not meet Specifications), less (ii) the quantity of Product actually
ordered and taken by Buyer during such year, multiplied by P..

The damages Seller would suffer if Buyer fails to purchase the Minimum Annual Purchase Obligation would be difficult to calculate;
therefore, in lieu of any other damages, the Shortfall Payment will constitute a reasonable estimate of such damages and will be
construed as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Payment of the Shortfall Payment will release Buyer from all purchase obligations
and all other liabilities for the failure to purchase the Minimum Annual Purchase Obligations and will constitute Seller’s sole and
exclusive remedy for such failure to purchase.

Licensed Use of Unloading Equipment:

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, INVISTA hereby grants to Buyer, and Buyer hereby accepts a limited,
nontransferable, nonexclusive, revocable, royalty-free license to use INVISTA-owned unloading equipment for use in unloading or
transloading Product purchased by Buyer from INVISTA under this Agreement (the “Leased Equipment”) during the Term of this
Agreement. Buyer will use and protect the Leased Equipment in accordance with good industry standards and compliance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations. Buyer may not, in whole or part, sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer the rights granted
hereunder. All rights not specifically granted to Buyer hereunder are reserved to INVISTA. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold INVISTA harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, obligations, actions,
demands, proceedings, losses, risks, awards, settlements, judgments, liabilities, costs, expenses, and damages (including, without
limitation, attorney’s fees and court costs, and any damage to the Leased Equipment regardless of how caused) directly or indirectly
based on, arising from, or related to (a) any breach of Buyer’s obligations under this Agreement, (b) the sale or use of Products or the
operations or business conducted by Buyer, or (c) Buyer’s use of the Leased Equipment. For avoidance of doubt, Leased Equipment is
defined as an INVISTA designed, fabricated, and owned metal unloading pan, leased royalty-free from Seller to Buyer for the sole
purpose of use by Buyer during unloading of Product delivered by Seller in Seller’s railcars.

Payment Terms:
Seller shall submit an invoice to Buyer on the last day of each month for all shipments of Product during that calendar month. Payment

shall be submitted to Seller by Buyer via ACH, in U.S. currency, no later than 30 days from the date of Seller’s invoice. In the event of
late or non-payment by the Buyer, subject to notice to Buyer with 5 days to cure, in addition to any other remedies available to Seller at
law or in equity, Seller may (i) suspend deliveries of Product, {1i) require prepayment by wire transfer of immediately available funds
prior to any future scheduled shipments of Product or (111) terminate this Agreement.

The Product specifications and pricing formula set out on the attached Exhibit A, and the Terms and Conditions of Sale set out on the
attached Exhibit B are made a part of this Agreement by this reference. All purchases and sales of Product under this Agreement are
INVISTA CONFIDENTIAL

expressly limited to and conditioned upon acceptance of this Sales Agreement and the provisions of such Exhibits. Unless expressly
agreed to by both parties in writing, signed by both parties, any additional or conflicting terms and conditions contained on, attached to
or referenced by any Buyer's order, or any other prior or later communication between the parties, shall have no effect on this

Agreement.

Product Contract Pricing:

Price:
The Selling Price (P) for Product is determined each calendar month during the period in effect using the following formula.

P =P, + F + 0.0966 *(BZ) + 0.0001 *(NH3) + 0.0163 *(NG)

Where:

P = the Contract Price for Product in U.S. dollars per pound (rounded to 4 decimal places, $X.XXXX/Ib) for the current calendar month. Price
may also be shown in US§ per metric ton calculated by multiplying selling price in US$ per pound by 2204,.623 and rounding to the nearest
whole dollar (3X,XXX/MT).

P.. = US$ 0.371 per pound (fixed portion of formula)

F = US$ 0.020 per pound for bulk hopper truck shipments
F = US$ 0.050 per pound for 1000kg bags shipments
There is no additional charge for railcar shipments (in effect, F = US$ 0).

BZ = the U.S. monthly contract benzene price, in US dollars per gallon, as published in IHS Chemical (formerly CMAI) Aromatics Market
Weekly for the month Product is shipped, rounded to three decimal places.

NH3 = the price for ammonia as reported by FERTECON AMMONIA REPORT, under the heading, “FERTECON PRICE SERVICE”,
“AMMONIA PRICE INDICATIONS”, Delivered Prices, “US Gulf/Tampa” - “Tampa”, as the average of the weekly prices published the
month Product is shipped, expressed in US$ per metric ton for anhydrous ammonia, rounded to three decimal places.

NG = the unrounded NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures closing price on the contract settlement date, as expressed in US$ per MMBtu,
for the month Product is shipped.

a) Ifthe benzene, natural gas and/or ammonia publications specify the price as a range, the reference price for adjusting the price for
Product, will be the average of the high and low published prices.

Pricing Example: The July 2018 Adipic Acid price for rail deliveries under the terms proposed in this agreement is shown below. Each month
a price notification will be sent to Buyer.

Pricing Inputs:
P. = $0.37 1b, , BZ = $2.990/gallon, NH3 = $258.000/MT, NG = $2.875/mmbtu

Pricing Calculation:
P ($/mt) = $0.371 + (0.0966*$2.990) + (0.0001*$258.000) + (0.0163*$2.875)
P = $0.732/Ib

specifications for the specific Product sold hereunder; and (ii) INVISTA will deliver good title to the Product and that the Product shall
be delivered free of liens or encumbrances. Buyer, having the expertise and knowledge in the intended use of Product sold hereunder and
any use or other product or material made therefrom, assumes all risk and liability for results obtamed by the Use of Product, whether
used singly or in combination with other substances or in any process. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, INVISTA

OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE PRODUCT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE

USE CONTEMPLATED BY BUYER IS BUYER'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY.

CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL INVISTA BE LIABLE TO BUYER FOR ANY LOST OR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, LOST EARNINGS, LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WHETHER OR NOT BASED UPON
INVISTA'S NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, IN TORT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION.

DAMAGES REFERENCED IN §2-715 OF THE NEW YORK UCC. Buyer's exclusive remedy vis-a-vis INVISTA for any cause of
action under the Agreement, including for failure to deliver or late delivery, is, at INVISTA's option limited to (i) replacement of the nonconforming Product; or (11) refund to Buyer of the portion of the purchase price attributable to such non-conforming Product. In no event
shall INVISTA's cumulative liability exceed the price of Product sold which was the direct cause of the alleged loss, damage or injury. IN
ANY EVENT, BUYER AGREES THAT THE RETURN OF THE FULL SALES PRICE FOR THAT PRODUCT SOLD WHICH WAS
THE CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY WILL PREVENT THE FOREGOING REMEDIES FROM
FAILING OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, AND THAT SUCH REMEDY IS FAIR AND ADEQUATE.

DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the failure by Buyer to provide performance assurance when due; (11)
INVISTA shall not have received a payment due from Buyer hereunder by the date such payment is due under the Agreement, and such
failure shall remain uncured for a period of fifteen (15) days; (iii) the failure of Buyer to perform any other obligation in the Agreement

proceeds of such sale the purchase price and all reasonable costs resulting from Buyer's default as identified above, including, without
limitation, all costs associated with the transportation (including demurrage and other vessel or shipping related charges), storage, and
sale of the Product. The foregoing nghts, which shall include, but not be limited to, specific performance, shall be cumulative and

default, and interest on past due amounts at the rate specified in Section 10(a) hereof. "Bankruptcy Event" means the occurrence of any of

similar official appointed with respect to it or any substantial portion of its property or assets; or (vi) being generally unable to pay its
debts as they fall due.

. PATENT INFRINGEMENT ARISING FROM PRODUCT USE. Buyer expressly assumes the risk of and agrees, to the fullest extent

permitted by Law, to indemnify, defend, and hold the Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Claims for patent infringement
by reason of Buyer's use of Product provided hereunder, whether used singly or in combination with other product or material, or in the
operation of any process.

. SPECIALTY MANUFACTURED PRODUCT. If the Agreement covers Products that must be manufactured especially for Buyer, and

the Agreement is suspended, terminated or cancelled for any reason, Buyer will take delivery of and make payment for such Products as
have been completed and such Products as are in process on the date notice of suspension, termination or cancellation is received by
INVISTA. If Buyer for any reason cannot accept delivery of such Products, Buyer will make payment therefor as though delivery has
been made and INVISTA will store such Products for Buyer's account and at Buyer's expense.

. EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. (a) Force Majeure: The parties will be excused from their respective performances hereunder (except

Buyer's payment obligations) if performance is prevented or delayed by any acts of God, fire, explosion, flood, unusually severe or
abnormal weather, riots or other civil disturbances, wars, acts of terrorism, actions of governments, voluntary or involuntary compliance
with any Law or request of any governmental authority, strikes, lockouts or other labor difficulties, failure of usual sources of raw
materials or other sources of supply, failure of computer systems to operate properly, destruction or loss of electronic records or data,
failure of mechanical or chemical function or equipment normally used by INVISTA for manufacturing, handling or delivering of
Product, or internally produced intermediates used in manufacture of any of the Product, plant shutdowns, any necessity to not operate, or
to reduce operation of, equipment in order to protect the safety of people or to protect the environment, or any circumstances beyond the
reasonable control of the party seeking excuse from performance ("force majeure”). Promptly after a party determines a force majeure
condition exists, that party will notify the other of the circumstances and consequences claimed and will use reasonable means to remove
the cause(s) in question. Neither party will be obligated to settle any demands of, or disputes with, laborers; nor will Buyer be excused
from paying monies due or complying with INVISTA's credit terms. Quantities affected by force majeure will be deleted from the
Agreement, but the Agreement will otherwise continue in full force and effect for the term set forth in the Agreement. In periods of
shortage of Product due to force majeure, INVISTA may apportion any reduced quantity of Product among itself and its customers and
affiliates in an equitable manner. INVISTA shall not be required to acquire Product to replenish any shortfall in Product arising as a result
of a force majeure. Should INVISTA acquire any quantity of Product following a force majeure, INVISTA may use or distribute, without
