Price: The Selling Price (P) for Product will be determined each calendar month during the period
in effect using the following formula.

P= Pc +213 *(BZ) + .24 *(NH3) + 36 *(NG)

Where:

P = the Selling Price for Product in U.S. dollars per metric ton (rounded to the nearest whole $) for
the current calendar month. For reference purposes only, price may also be shown in US$ per Ib

calculated by dividing selling price in US$ per metric ton by 2204.623.

Pc = US$ 560/metric ton
 

BZ = the U.S. monthly contract benzene price, in US dollars per gallon, as published in IHS
Chemical (formerly CMAI) Aromatics Market Weekly for the month that is one month
immediately prior to the month Product is shipped, rounded to three decimal places.

NH3 = the price for ammonia as reported by FERTECON AMMONIA REPORT, under the
heading, “FERTECON PRICE SERVICE”, “AMMONIA PRICE INDICATIONS”, Delivered
Prices, “US Gulf/Tampa” - “Tampa”, as the average of the weekly prices published from the
month two months prior to the month Product is shipped, expressed in US$ per metric ton for
anhydrous ammonia, rounded to three decimal places.

settlement date, as expressed in US$ per MMBtu, for the month that is one month immediately
prior to the month Product is shipped.

If the benzene, natural gas and/or ammonia publications specify the price as a range, the
reference price for adjusting the price for Product, will be the average of the high and low
published prices.
