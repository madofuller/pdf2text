such fixed Price for the aforesaid period, it shall propose a new fixed Price and Buyer
shall have the option to choose between the new fixed Price or the following dry basis
formula per MT for the period from January 1, 2015 through March 3], 2015. From
April 1, 2015, the Price of the Product shall be calculated on the following dry basis
formula per MT.

$1260 + (BD * .55) + (AM * 0.46) + (NG * 55) + C3 Factor
Where:

BD = The North American Butadiene Contract price, as published in the IHS Chemical
Market Advisory Services Market Reports “Global C4 & Elastomers Market Advisory
Service”, applicable issue “Market Report” under the heading “Product Prices”, “Crude
C4s & Butadiene”, “Butadiene, Contract”, “N. America” for the month that is one month
immediately previous to the month Product is purchased and the title passes, expressed
USD ($) per MT. If more than one price is published in any month, the Butadiene price
for that month will be the arithmetic average of the published prices for the month,
unrounded.

AM = The monthly average, unrounded, of the weekly Tampa ammonia prices, for the
month that is one month immediately previous to the month Product is purchased and the
title passes, for each week that falls within the relevant calendar month, as published in
the weekly FERTECON AMMONIA REPORT, under the headings, “FERTECON
PRICE SERVICE”, “AMMONIA PRICE INDICATIONS”, “Delivered prices”, “US
Gulf/Tampa - Tampa,” expressed in US$ per MT for anhydrous ammonia. If a range of

#75638

(b)

(d)

prices is published for a given week, then an arithmetic average of the low and high
prices (unrounded) shall be used. If a price is not published for a given week within the
relevant calendar month then the previous week’s price shall be used.

NG = The price, unrounded, of natural gas expressed in USD per MMBtu for the month
that is one month immediately previous to the month Product is purchased and the title
passes, as reported by Intercontinental Exchange®, Inc. (“ICE”) as the “ICE Month
Ahead Natural Gas Price Report” on the web site:
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reportcenter/reports.htm, by selecting “Indices” in
the “Category” box, “ICE OTC” in the “Market” box, “North American Natural Gas” in
the “Report” box, “Month Ahead Index” and “Houston Ship Channel-Houston Pipe Line
Pool” in the “Hub” box. If more than one price is published in any month, the price for
that month will be the arithmetic average of the published prices for the month,
unrounded.

C3 Factor- IF: 2*C3 > BD > 1.25*C3, THEN C3 FACTOR=0
IF: BD < 1,25*C3, THEN C3 FACTOR = [(1.25*C3) — BD]*0.55
IF: BD > 2*C3, THEN C3 FACTOR = [(2*C3) — BD]*0.55

C3 = The unrounded published price of US Contract Propylene, as published in the IHS
Chemical Market Advisory Services “Database Services”, “Prices and Economics”, by
selecting “Propylene”, then “Propylene Chemical Grade — Contract Benchmark — North
America — Cents/pound — Delivered United States”, converted to USD ($) per MT by
multiplying by 22.04623, unrounded, for the month that is one month immediately
previous to the month when Product is delivered. If more than one price is published in
any month, the price for that month will be the unrounded arithmetic average of the
published prices.

(c)

(iii)

For purposes of determining the weight for a credit or debit invoice, the Seller’s
bill of lading weight is subtracted from Buyer’s offloaded weight and then
adjusted as follows (the ‘Adjusted Weight”):

ainount to Buyer. Such reduction shall not result in a debit amount to
Buyer.

(2) If the resulting amount is a positive number, indicating a debit to Buyer,
the debit amount shall not be reduced by 0.1 MT for determination of the
debit to Buyer.

EXAMPLE:

° Seller solution weight is 80 tons for all railcars.
. 3 railcars shipped in the month of August.

. August price is $2570/ton.

Railcar #1: Buyer offload amount is 78 tons.

Heels calculation railcar #1: ((78 - 80) + 0.1)*0.9*$2570/ton = $-4395 [a
credit amount]

Railcar #2: Buyer offload amount is 82 tons.

Heels calculation railcar #2: (82 - 80)*0.9*$2570 = $4626 [a debit
amount]

Railcar #3: Buyer offload amount is 79.9 tons.

Heels calculation railcar #3: ((79.9 — 80) + 0.1)*0.9* $2570/ton = $0 [no
credit or debit amount]

TOTAL SUMMARY INVOICE: A debit invoice in the amount of $231 for
August heels to be issues by INVISTA by September 20 based on the heels
report submitted by Solvay by September 10.

The maximum weight discrepancy (Seller’s bill of lading weight subtracted from
Buyer's offloaded weight) of any individual railcar shall be 1.500 MT. For
weight discrepancies over this amount, a railcar problem report shall be issued to
Seller, an investigation of the discrepancy shall occur and the discrepancy will be

WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, IN TORT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION
WHATSOEVER. FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, THE PRECEDING SENTENCE
INCLUDES THOSE INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES REFERENCED IN
§2-715 OF THE NEW YORK UCC.

Buyer’s' exclusive remedy against Seller for any cause of action under this Agreement, including,
without limitation, for delivery of non-conforming Product or for failure to deliver or late
delivery of Product, is, at Seller’s option limited to (a) replacement of the non-conforming
Product with a Product which conforms to the Specifications; or (b) refund to Buyer the Price
actually paid to Seller with respect to the non-conforming Product (including shipping costs paid
by Company), and Seller will be responsible for shipping costs related to the return of nonconforming Product. In no event shall Seller's cumulative liability exceed the Price of Product
sold which was the direct cause of the alleged loss, damage or injury, except for such shipping
costs related to the return of non-conforming Product. IN ANY EVENT, BUYER AGREES
THAT THE RETURN OF THE FULL SALES PRICE FOR THAT PRODUCT SOLD WHICH
WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY WILL PREVENT THE
FOREGOING REMEDIES FROM FAILING OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, AND THAT
SUCH REMEDY IS FAIR AND ADEQUATE.

Indemnities for Third Party Claims. Subject to Section 16, each Party shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the other Party, the other Party’s affiliates and their respective employees,
officers, directors and stockholders from and against any and all claims, demands, lawsuits,
causes of action, strict liability claims, penalties, fines, administrative law actions and orders,
expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) and costs and liabilities of every kind and
character which may arise from the breach, negligence or misconduct of the indemnifying Party
in connection with the indemnifying Party’s performance of this Agreement.

Excused Performance.

(a) Force Majeure. Each Party will be excused from its performance under this Agreement
(except Buyer’s payment obligations) if its performance is prevented or delayed by any
acts of God, fire, explosion, flood, unusually severe or abnormal weather, riots or other
civil disturbances, wars, acts of terrorism, actions of governments, voluntary or
involuntary compliance with any Law or request of any governmental authority, strikes,
lockouts or other labor difficulties, failure of usual sources of raw materials or other
sources of supply, failure of computer systems to operate properly, destruction or loss of
electronic records or data, failure of mechanical or chemical function or equipment
normally used by such Party for manufacturing, handling or delivering of Product, or
internally produced intermediates used by such Party in the manufacturing or processing
of any of Product, plant shutdowns, any necessity not to operate, or to reduce operation
of, equipment in order to protect the safety of people or to protect the environment, or
any circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Party seeking excuse from
performance (“force_majeure”). Promptly after a Party determines a force majeure
condition exists, such Party shall notify the other Party of the circumstances and
consequences claimed and shall use reasonable means to remove the causes in question.
In the event of a force majeure, neither Party shall not be obligated to settle any demands
of, or disputes with, laborers; nor shall either Party be excused from paying monies due
or complying with credit terms under this Agreement. Quantities affected by force
majeure shall be deleted from this Agreement, but this Agreement shall otherwise
continue in full force and effect for the terms set forth in this Agreement. In periods of
shortage of Product due to force majeure, Seller may apportion any reduced quantity of

12
19.

20.

#75638

Product among itself and its customers and affiliates in an equitable manner. Seller shall
not be required to acquire Product to replenish any shortfall in Product arising as a result
of a force majeure. If Seller acquires any quantity of Product following a force majeure,
Seller may use or distribute, without apportioning, such Product at its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any quantity of Product Seller acquires and distributes to
any non-affiliated customers shall be equitably apportioned to all of Seller’s nonaffiliated customers. Under no circumstances shall Seller be obligated to obtain Product
for delivery hereunder except from its designated sources of supply, or if none is so
designated by Seller, from its usual, customary and/or most recent sources of supply.

(b) Commercial Impracticability. Both Seller and Buyer may suspend performance and/or
terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, without liability, if for any reason, Seller or
Buyer shuts down the unit(s), or the manufacturing facility at which Product (or the
feedstock for the Product) is made or consumed upon twelve (12) months prior written
notice, or if a change in circumstances (whether foreseeable or unforeseeable) causes
Seller or Buyer to incur a loss on a full cost basis at any time on the sale or consumption
of Product hereunder from the unit or the manufacturing facility.

(c) Adverse Impact of Law. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement are subject to
applicable Laws. If, at any time after the date of this Agreement, any such Law should be
amended or proposed to be amended or if new Laws are enacted or proposed to be
enacted that would have an adverse economic impact upon either Party (including, as
examples and without limitation, Laws that would require either Party to install antipollution equipment, to purchase credits under any cap and trade program or regulations
or in any way alter any manufacturing facility or any part of the facilities or the use of the
facilities that are a part of the manufacturing facility) (an “Adverse Law Impact”), then
the Party subject to the Adverse Law Impact may request discussions to amend this
Agreement to relieve such Adverse Law Impact (but only to the extent of the Adverse
Law Impact). The Party requesting the discussions shall provide to the other Party
reasonable detail of the circumstances, consequences and extent of the Adverse Law
Impact. If the Parties do not mutually agree on an amendment within sixty (60) days.
then the Party subject to the Adverse Law Impact may terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to the other Party.

Confidentiality. Buyer and Seller shall treat as confidential all Product pricing, sales data and
specifications (the “Confidential Information”), and shall (i) keep the Confidential Information
confidential and not disclose it to any third party, (ii) use Confidential Information only as
necessary for the performance of this Agreement, and (iii) limit the disclosure of the Confidential
Information to those of its employees necessary for the performance of this Agreement, unless
prior written consent has been granted by the Buyer or Seller to permit other use or disclosure. To
the extent that Buyer and Seller maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and
for the duration of this Agreement, Seller nor Buyer will not disclose to any person (except for its
affiliates, employees, auditors, attorneys or other representatives, or as may be required as a
matter of law, rule, regulation, or legal or administrative proceeding) Buyer’s Product pricing and
volumes under this Agreement.

Patent Representation. To Seller’s knowledge, the Product that Seller supplies to Buyer does
not infringe the valid patent rights of any third party. Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and Buyer’s affiliates, contractors, agents, resellers, and customers from and
against any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, causes of action, strict liability claims, penalties,
fines, administrative law actions and orders, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and

expenses) and costs incurred because of the actual or alleged infringement of any patent,
copyright, trade secret, trademark, maskwork, or other intellectual property right of a third party
arising out of or in connection with the Product in the form delivered to the Buyer hereunder,
provided that: (a) Buyer shall notify Seller as soon as reasonably possible after Buyer receives
notice of any such claim; (b) Seller shall have the right to direct the defense and approve
settlement; and (c) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in the defense of any claim.

Trademarks. Except as may be contained in a separate trademark license, the sale of Product
(even if accompanied by documents using a trade mark or trade name) does not convey a license,
express or implied, to use any trademark or trade name and Buyer shall not use a trade mark or
trade name of Seller's in connection with the Product.

Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written
consent of the other. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this agreement to an
affiliated or subsidiary company, or to a company growing out of a consolidation of or acquisition
by or merger with that party, or to a company or entity acquiring the majority of that party’s assets
related to the production or consumption of Product. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the successors and, if properly assigned, the assigns of both Parties.

Governing Law and Venue for Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
according to the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any choice of law rules which may
direct the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or any subsequently enacted treaty or convention
shall not apply or govern the Agreement or the performance thereof or any aspect of any dispute
arising therefrom. Any action or proceeding between the Parties relating to this Agreement shall
be commenced and maintained exclusively in Wilmington, Delaware and each Party submits
itself unconditionally and irrevocably to the personal jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware.

Amendment. Neither Party shall claim any amendment, modification or release of any
provisions hereof unless the same is in writing and such writing: (a) specifically refers to this
Agreement; (b) specifically identifies the terms amended; and (c) is signed by duly authorized
representatives of Seller and Buyer. No statements or agreements, oral or written, not contained
herein, or in a future amendment hereto executed by both Parties, shall vary or modify the terms
hereof. All technical advice, services and recommendations by Seller are intended for use by
persons having skill and know-how, and are accepted by Buyer at its own risk and Seller assumes
no responsibility for results obtained or damages incurred from their use.

Independent Contractors. Seller and Buyer are independent contractors only and are not
partners, master/servant, primcipal/agent or involved herein as Parties to any other similar legal
relationship with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement or otherwise, and
no fiduciary, trust or advisor relationship, nor any other relationship, imposing vicarious liability
shall exist between the Parties under this Agreement or otherwise at Law.

No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Agreement is solely for the benefit of Seller and Buyer and
shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to any third party any right, Claim, cause of action or
interest herein.

Notices. All notices and other comninications under this Agreement must be in writing and will
be deemed duly given (a) on the date of delivery, if delivered personally or by electronic mail
