maximum quantity of Product equal to 40% of Buyer’s total annual requirement
(estimated to be 3,900 metric tons) for the HMD during each Contract Year (as defined

purchase from Seller a minimum quantity of Product equal to the Purchase Shortfall as a
part of, and not in addition to, the quantity of Product shipped by Seller in the month
following the month in which Buyer incurs the Purchase Shortfall. Seller shall invoice
Buyer for the quantity of Product comprising the Purchase Shortfall using the Price
calculated for the month in which the Purchase Shortfall quantity was actually ordered by
Buyer. The purchase by Buyer of the Purchase Shortfall quantity at the foregoing Price
shall be Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy related to any Purchase Shortfall. The
exception will be in the event of an unplanned shutdown of greater than three (3) days at
